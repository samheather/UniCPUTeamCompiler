UniCPUTeamCompiler
==================

**Big important note: toggle debug mode at the top for code readability - if on, output not compilable, if off, output very difficult to read.**

To compile:
* Place your program code in a file called 'program.uni', in the same directory as compiler.py
* Open a shell here, and execute 'python compiler.py'
* Compiled code is output

To do:
* Convert output string to bytestring (i.e. group 8bits into a single byte, rather than using 1 byte for each character) (easy)
* Write output to file (easy)
* Add support for code labels for jump instructions, as opposed to jump to line number, so they can jump to character labels.
